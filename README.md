## PMD Gen

This is a website for password generation for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX. This is my first full project written in Go, so if you are a more seasoned Go dev and noticed some things I can improve, please don't hesitate to let me know!

## Credits

Huge thanks to [zaksabeast](https://github.com/zaksabeast), who made [this documentation](https://gist.github.com/zaksabeast/fed5730156e26fb3e805e234fcbea60b) on how RT DX's password system worked, as well as [mid-kid](https://github.com/mid-kid), who has also created a password tool for RT DX, and who much of my code is largely based off of.
